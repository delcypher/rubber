This is Rubber.

Rubber is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
runs (hopefully) just as many compilations as necessary. The module system
provides a great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package
with no user intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the
document.

Compiling and running Rubber requires Python, and nothing more. I don't know
which version is required, but I think Python 2 is needed.

To compile and install Rubber, just follow the usual procedure:

	./configure
	make
	make install

The options for configuration can be shown using ./configure --help.

Rubber is written and maintained by Emmanuel Beffara <emmanuel@beffara.org>.
Any kind of feedback is appreciated, in order to make this program as useful,
robust and powerful as possible...
