%description
This is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
runs just as many compilations as necessary. The module system provides a
great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with no user
intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. The
standard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, pdftex,
makeindex, cweb and graphics/graphicx (currently with automatic epstopdf and
XFig picture conversion and Metapost compilation).
