Description: an automated system for building LaTeX documents
 This is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a routine that
 runs just as many compilations as necessary. The module system provides a
 great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with no user
 intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. The
 standard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, pdftex,
 makeindex, cweb and graphics/graphicx (currently with automatic epstopdf and
 XFig picture conversion and Metapost compilation).
