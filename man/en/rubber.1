.TH RUBBER 1
.SH NAME
rubber \- a building system for LaTeX documents

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rubber
.RI [ options ]
.I sources ...
.br
.B rubber-pipe
.RI [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Rubber is a wrapper for LaTeX and companion programs. Its purpose is, given a
LaTeX source to process, to compile it enough times to resolve all references,
possibly running satellite programs such as BibTeX, makeindex, Metapost, etc.
to produce appropriate data files.

The command
.B rubber
builds the specified documents completely. The source files may be either
LaTeX sources (in which case the suffix .tex may be omitted) or documents in a
format Rubber knows how to translate into LaTeX (this currently means CWEB or
Literate Haskell documents). If one compilation fails, the whole process
stops, including the compilation of the next documents on the command line,
and
.B rubber
returns a non-zero exit code.

The command
.B rubber-pipe
does the same for one document but it reads the LaTeX source from standard
input and dumps the compiled document on standard output.

Some information cannot be extracted from the LaTeX sources. This is the case,
for instance, with the search paths (which can be specified in environment
variables like TEXINPUTS), or the style to be used with Makeindex. To address
this problem, one can add information for Rubber in the comments of the LaTeX
sources, see section Directives.

.SH OPTIONS
The options are used either to choose the action to be performed or to
configure the building process. They are mostly the same in
.B rubber
and
.BR rubber-pipe .
Options are parsed using GNU Getopt conventions.
.TP
.B --clean
Remove all files produced by the compilation, instead
of building the document. This option is present in \fBrubber\fR only. It
applies to the compilation as it would be done with the other options of the
command line, i.e. saying
"rubber --clean foo"
will not delete foo.ps, while saying
"rubber --ps --clean foo"
will.
.TP
.BI -c,\ --command \ <command>
Execute the specified command (or directive). See section "Directives" for
details.
.TP
.B -f, --force
Force at least one compilation of the source. This may be useful, for
instance, if some unusual dependency was modified (e.g. a package in a system
directory). This option is irrelevant in
.BR rubber-pipe .
.TP
.B -h, --help
Display the list of all available options and exit nicely.
.TP
.B -k, --keep
This option is for
.B rubber-pipe
only. With this option, the temporary files will not be removed after
compiling the document and dumping the results on standard output. The
temporary document is named rubtmpX.tex, where X is a number such that no file
of that name exists initially.
.TP
.B -l, --landscape
Specify that the final document should
use landscape orientation. This is relevant only when using
.B dvips
or
.BR dvipdfm .
.TP
.BI -m,\ --module \ <module> [: <args> ]
Use the specified module in addition to the document's packages. Arguments
can be passed to the package by adding them after a colon, they correspond to
the package options in LaTeX.
.TP
.B -d, --pdf
Use pdfLaTeX instead of LaTeX in order to produce PDF output instead of DVI.
This option is a synonym for
.IR --module\ pdftex .
.TP
.B -p, --ps
Process the DVI produced by the process
through
.BR dvips (1)
to produce a PostScript document. This option is a
synonym for
.IR --module\ dvips ,
it is naturally incompatible with
.IR --pdf .
.TP
.B -q, --quiet
Suppress all messages during the process.
.TP
.BI -r,\ --read \ <file>
Read additional directives form the specified file (see also the directive
"read").
.TP
.B -s, --short
Display LaTeX's error messages in a compact form (one error per line).
.TP
.B -v, --verbose
Increase the verbosity level. The default level is 0, levels up to 3 exist.
Beware, saying
.I -vvv
makes Rubber speak a lot.
.TP
.B --version
Print the version number and exit nicely.
.PP

.SH MODULES
Rubber's action is influenced by modules. Modules take care of the particular
features of packages and external programs.

.SS Packages
For every package that a document uses, Rubber looks for a module of the same
name to perform the tasks that this package my require apart from the
compilation by LaTeX. Modules can be added to the ones provided by default to
include new features (this is the point of the module system). The standard
modules are the following:
.TP
.B beamer
This module handles Beamer's .head files the same way as other tables of
contents.
.TP
.B bibtex
Takes care of processing the document's bibliography with BibTeX when needed.
This module is automatically loaded if the document contains the macro
\\bibliography (see also in "Directives" for options).
.TP
.B combine
The combine package is used to gather several LaTeX documents into a single
one, and this module handles the dependencies in this case.
.TP
.B epsfig
This modules handles graphics inclusion for the documents that use the old
style \\psfig macro. It is actually an interface for the graphics module, see
this one for details.
.TP
.B graphics, graphicx
These modules identify the graphics included in the document and consider them
as dependencies for compilation. They also use standard rules to build these
files with external programs. Current rules include conversion from EPS to PDF
using
.BR epstopdf (1),
conversion of XFig figures to EPS, combined EPS+LaTeX, PDF or PNG using
.BR fig2dev (1),
compilation of Metapost sources (using
.BR mpost (1)),
and bounding box extraction from gzipped EPS figures.
.TP
.B makeidx
Process the document's index with
.B makeindex
when needed (see section "Directives" for options).
.TP
.B minitoc, minitoc-hyper
On cleaning, remove additional files that produced to make partial tables of
contents.
.TP
.B moreverb, verbatim
Adds the files included with \\verbatiminput and similar macros to the list of
dependencies.
.TP
.B natbib
May cause an extra compilation to solve references.
.TP
.B xr
Add additional .aux files used for external references to the list of
dependencies, so recompiling is automatic when referenced document are
changed.
.PP

.SS Pre-processing
The following modules are provided for using programs that generate a LaTeX
source from a different file format:
.TP
.B cweb
This module's purpose is to run
.BR cweave (1)
if needed before the compiling process to produce the LaTeX source. This
module is automatically loaded if the file specified on the command line has
.B .w
as its suffix.
.TP
.B lhs2TeX
This module uses the
.B lhs2TeX
preprocessor to generate the LaTeX source from a Literate Haskell program. It
is automatically triggered if the input file's name ends with
.BR .lhs .
.PP

.SS Post-processing
The following modules are provided to support different kinds of
post-processings:
.TP
.B dvipdfm
Runs
.BR dvipdfm (1)
at the end of compilation to produce a PDF document.
.TP
.B dvips
Runs
.BR dvips (1)
at the end of compilation to produce a PostScript document. This module is
also loaded by the command line option
.IR --ps .
.TP
.B expand
Produce an expanded LaTeX source by replacing \\input macros by included
files, bibliography macros by the bibliography produced by
.BR bibtex (1),
and local classes and packages by their source. The module options
.I nobib, nocls, nopkg
turn off specific expansions. If the main file is
.I foo.tex
then then expanded file will be named
.IR foo-final.tex .
.PP

.SS Compiler choice
The following modules are used to change the LaTeX compiler:
.TP
.B pdftex
Instructs Rubber to use
.B pdflatex
instead of
.B latex
to compile the document into a PDF instead of a DVI. This module is also
loaded by the command line option
.IR --pdf .
.TP
.B vtex
Instructs Rubber to use the VTeX compiler. By default this uses
.B vlatex
as the compiler to produce PDF output. With the option
.B ps
(e.g. when saying "rubber -m vtex:ps foo.tex") the compiler used is
.B vlatexp
and the result is a PostScript file.
.PP

.SH DIRECTIVES
The automatic behavior of Rubber is based on searching for macros in the LaTeX
sources. When this is not enough, directives can be added in the comments of
the sources. A directive is a line like
.RS
% rubber: cmd args
.RE
The line must begin with a "%", then any sequence of "%" signs and
spaces, then the text "rubber:" followed by spaces and a command name,
possibly followed by spaces and arguments.
.SS General directives
.TP
.BI clean \ <file>
Indicates that the specified file should be removed when cleaning using
.IR --clean .
.TP
.BI depend \ <file>
Consider the specified file as a dependency, so that its modification time
will be checked.
.TP
.BI module \ <module> \ [ <options> ]
Loads the specified module, possibly with options. This is equivalent to the
command-line option
.IR --module .
.TP
.BI paper \ <options>
Specify options related to paper size. Currently they are used to give
.I -t
options to
.B dvips
and
.I -p
options to
.BR dvipdfm .
.TP
.BI path \ <directory>
Adds the specified directory to the search path for TeX (and Rubber). The name
of the directory is everything that follows the spaces after "path".
.TP
.BI read \ <file>
Read the specified file of directives. The file
must contain one directive per line. Empty lines and lines that begin with
"%" are ignored.
.TP
.BI watch \ <file>
Watch the specified file for changes. If the contents of this file has changed
after a compilation, then another compilation is triggered. This is useful in
the case of tables of contents, for instance.
.PP
.SS Module-specific directives
If a command has the form
.IR foo.bar ,
it is considered a command
.I bar
for the module
.IR foo .
If this module is not registered when the directive is found, then it is
loaded with no option and the command is executed. For the standard modules,
the directives are the following:
.TP
.BI bibtex.path \ <directory>
Adds the specified directory to the search path for BibTeX databases (.bib
files).
.TP
.BI bibtex.stylepath \ <directory>
Adds the specified directory to the search path for BibTeX styles (.bst
files).
.TP
.BI dvipdfm.options \ <options>
Pass the specified command-line switches to
.BR dvipdfm .
.TP
.BI dvips.options \ <options>
Pass the specified command-line switches to
.BR dvips .
.TP
.BI makeidx.order \ <options>
Modifies the sorting options for the index. Tha argument must be a
space-separated list of words among "standard", "german" and "letter".
.TP
.BI makeidx.path \ <directory>
Adds the specified directory to the search path for index styles (.ist files).
.TP
.BI makeidx.style \ <style>
Specifies the index style to be used.
